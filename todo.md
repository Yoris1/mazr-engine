# Todo

- [ ] Create a map editor that hooks into process memory and alters the map
- [ ] Create ability to save map from engine, to be able to make map editor way easier to code maybe?
- [ ] move map and texture_atlas to a separate folder for environment.
- [ ] move sdlm and vectors to their own utils folder.
- [ ] move raycaster to it's own render folder.
- [ ] Add transparency, to be able to place ghost blocks for testing stuff and in-game building?
- [ ] Add area lighting to maps.
